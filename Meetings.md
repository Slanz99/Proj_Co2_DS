    - How to deal with the catagorical values
    - Display some graphs 

## Summary of Aziz

> Goals for the week of August 7th: Write up your initial exploration of the dataset using the template. Try to identify the most relevant features -> display some correlation graphs. Think about how to handle missing     
 values. Display some graphs: the number of different vehicle brands, the distribution of CO2 emissions in the dataset, the temporal evolution of vehicle characteristics, and the correlations between features and target 
 values. How are you planning to encode your categorical variables

## Goals
[Google Table Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19EffSCbW8gdt67DQ4ZDm2azBAgCSZk_XFSyCPIuHPws/edit?usp=sharing)

    1. Wrtite initial exploration using the *Google Table Template* 
    2. Identify the most relevant `features`
    3. Display some correlation graphs
    4. How to handle missing values
    5. Display some graphs:
        - the number of different vehicle brands
        - the distribution of CO2 emissions in the dataset
        - the temporal evolution of vehicle characteristics
        - correlations between `features` and `target_values`
    6. How are you planning to encode your categorical variables

## Description of the project

Identifying the vehicles that emit the most CO2 is important to identify 
the technical characteristics that play a role in pollution. 
Predicting this pollution in advance makes it possible to prevent
the appearance of new types of vehicles (new series of cars for example).

1. Cars most CO2 emission
2. technical characteristics for 1.)
3. prediction of pollution to "cars"

## Data sets
### [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/emissions-de-co2-et-de-polluants-des-vehicules-commercialises-en-france/#_)
In this data set, you will find all the technical characteristics of vehicles marketed in ***France*** in ***2013***, 
as well as fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and pollutant emissions into the air.
### [EEA_EU](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/co2-cars-emission-20)
In this one: the CO2 emissions of all the cars that come out each year (several hundred thousand vehicles per year, 
the dataset for new cars from 2019 alone weighs more than 1gb) with a little more info than that govt data

 
## Validation conditions for the project: 
- an exploration, data visualization and data pre-processing report ;
- a modeling report ; 
- a final report.
